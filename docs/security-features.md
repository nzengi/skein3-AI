# Skein3 Security Features

## Overview
Skein3 is designed with advanced security features to provide robust protection against various cryptographic attacks and emerging threats.

## Quantum Resistance
- Multiple security levels (256, 512, 1024 bits)
- Lattice-based transformations
- Adaptive quantum-resistant modes

### Key Quantum Protection Mechanisms
- Dynamic key generation
- Entropy enhancement
- Multi-layer mixing functions

## Memory Protection
- Secure memory allocation
- Quantum-resistant memory wiping
- Memory fence protection
- Side-channel attack mitigation

## Neural Network Adaptation
- AI-driven hash complexity analysis
- Dynamic complexity thresholds
- Adaptive neural network weights

## Blockchain Security
- Merkle tree optimization
- Zero-knowledge proof support
- Blockchain-specific hash modes

## Licensing Protections
- Commercial feature gating
- Advanced security modes require commercial license
- Per-feature licensing control

## Attack Resistance
- Collision resistance
- Preimage resistance
- Length extension attack prevention
- Differential cryptanalysis protection

## Performance Security Trade-offs
- Configurable security vs performance settings
- Hardware acceleration support
- Multi-threading with security considerations

## Recommended Usage
```cpp
Skein3::Config config;
config.size = Skein3::HashSize::HASH_1024;  // Quantum-resistant mode
config.mem_protection = Skein3::MemoryProtectionMode::QUANTUM_RESISTANT;
config.neural_config.enable_neural_adaptation = true;
