# Skein3 Block Cipher Overview

Skein3 is a variant of the Skein block cipher family, specifically designed to operate on 3 words (192 bits) of data. It's a lightweight version of the original Skein cipher, optimized for systems where resource efficiency is crucial.

## Key Characteristics
- **Block Size**: 192 bits (3 x 64-bit words)
- **Key Size**: 192 bits
- **Tweak Size**: 192 bits
- **Number of Rounds**: 72
- **Architecture**: ARX (Addition, Rotation, XOR)

## Comparison with Skein2

| Feature | Skein3 | Skein2 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Block Size | 192 bits | 128 bits |
| Word Count | 3 words | 2 words |
| Memory Footprint | Larger | Smaller |
| Processing Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Security Level | Higher | Lower |

## Key Advantages
- Better security margin compared to Skein2
- Suitable for applications requiring 192-bit security
- Compatible with modern 64-bit architectures
- Maintains the ARX design philosophy

## Primary Use Cases
- Cryptographic hash functions
- Message authentication codes (MAC)
- Stream cipher construction
- Pseudo-random number generation
- Digital signatures

## Limitations
- Higher computational overhead than Skein2
- Increased memory requirements
- Slower performance on 32-bit systems

## Security Considerations
- Resistant to known cryptographic attacks
- Provides strong avalanche effect
- Secure against related-key attacks
- Maintains security properties of the Skein family

## Implementation Considerations
