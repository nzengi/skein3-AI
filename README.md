Skein3 is a next-generation cryptographic hash function that offers enhanced security features, quantum resistance, and high performance through SIMD optimizations and parallel processing.

## Key Features

- üîí **Enhanced Security**
  - Quantum-resistant design
  - Variable output sizes (256/512/1024 bits)
  - Advanced avalanche effect
  - Lattice-based transformations

- ‚ö° **High Performance**
  - SIMD optimizations (AVX2/SSE4.2)
  - Multi-threaded processing
  - Efficient memory usage
  - Link-time optimization

- üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Usage**
  - Multiple operation modes
  - Streaming support
  - Tree-based parallel hashing
  - MAC functionality

## Security Features

- **Quantum Resistance**: Implements lattice-based transformations
- **Variable Security Levels**: Supports 256, 512, and 1024-bit outputs
